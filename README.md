# Website_Blocker
The aim is to block the websites during working hours with the help of Python Code.

### Introduction 
This particular project is the part of my 'Data Analyst' internship program with Edulyt India.

This is the application of the basic python knowledge.

### Project Overview

This is currently being used in the firm in order to stop the employees from visiting non legitimate sites during their working hours.

This code basically gives control to Company admin to block a list of websites (like Facebook and other non-productive websites) during particular hours in a day.

The website blocker helps in the workflow of the employees where they do not engage with the unwanted websites that 
affects the efficiency of employees during working hours.
